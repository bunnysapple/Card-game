This is a personal project that I completed in JavaScript to help me better learn this programming language.
This is not a perfect piece, especially when it comes to the colors used, but I am considering this complete for now.

I wish to point out that none of the images that I have used belongs to me, nor do I claim them. The original creator is @catalyststuff and I came across these images on freepik.com. If the original creator has any issues with me using these images I would be glad to remove all images from this project.

I hope you've enjoyed this little project that I have made.
Thank you.
